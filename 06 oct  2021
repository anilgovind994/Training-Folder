OOPS Concepts:
1. Encapsulation-
  data binding : Any variable/function that is declared inside a class should          not be accessible without that specific class
  

2. Abstraction-
data hiding : hide irrelevant information through end user only necessary details should be provided

 abstract method (a method which does not have a definition or [incomplete method]) 
we cannot create object in a abstract class
and 
 interface{ used for defining a standard to qualify a type}

3. Inheritance- it will extend exiting function of a parent
 reusability ()

overriding: method name, return type  and variables are same but task or (member functions) are different

4. polymorphism
 extension(overloading) : return type and variables are different but method       
 name is same
