java frameworks- Spring,Hibernate,struts,jsf,etc


API-application programming interface -lot of readymade 

Spring (core FrameWork) -most used framework -spring boot

1.project -web application,standalone
2.server-tomcat
3.database-
4.html pages


spring is a applicatio framework 
it works on principle IOC-Inversion of control -use fpr dependency injection


dependency injection (via binding)-dependent classes are injected to parent class using ioc container-creating objests

1.setter getter injection

2.constructor injection


IOC containers-- beanfactory ,application conetext
