Class – Blue Print for defining members and fuctions (methos)
Coding standard: Class name should start with capital letter method and variable name should start with lower case

Constructor- Is used creating instance of a class , JVM by default will create this constructor
Constructor is of two types:
1. Default Constructor-set default values to instance variables
2. Parameterised Constructor-to initialise data members of a class with distinct values
1. Instance Variables –only objects can access, stored in heap memory 
2. static Variables-No need of objects ,It can be accessed directly ,stored in static memory
*Memory Model (static memory and heap memory) :
    >RAM provide some memory to jvm, jvm will setup memory location using memory model  
    >Stack Memory-contain methods, variables, etc..
    >Heap Memory-Objects are stored here
    >Garbage collector: This will be responsible for checking if the memory allocated for application is sufficient or not
