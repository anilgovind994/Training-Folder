1. what is difference between exception and error?
a.Exceptions are those which can be handled at the run time whereas errors cannot be handled. ... An Error is something that most of the time you cannot handle it. Errors are unchecked exception and the developer is not required to do anything with these.

2. how can we handle exceptions in java
a.The try-catch is the simplest method of handling exceptions. Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any Java exceptions that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks. This method will catch any type of Java exceptions that get thrown.we also use throw and throws concepts of exception handling.

3. what is throw and throws
Both throw and throws are concepts of exception handling in Java. The throws keyword is used to declare which exceptions can be thrown from a method, while the throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method or block of code.

4. why do we need exception handling
a.Java exception handling is important because it helps maintain the normal, desired flow of the program even when unexpected events occur. If Java exceptions are not handled, programs may crash or requests may fail. ... There can be many causes for a sudden crash of the system, such as incorrect or unexpected data input.

5. what is exception hierarhy
a.                               
                                 object
                                <class>
                                     ^
                                     |
                               Throwable
		   <class>
                                      ^

             <class>                                   <class>


6. how can we create user defined runtime and compile time exceptions
a.In order to create a custom compile time exception all you have to do is to extend Exception class.
if you want to write a runtime exception, you need to extend the RuntimeException class.

7. what is try with resources
a.The try -with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it. The try -with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement. Any object that implements java. lang.

8. can we have try, try and finally without catch block
a.Yes, we can have try without catch block by using finally block. You can use try with finally. As you know finally block always executes even if you have exception or return statement in try block except in case of System.

9. explain the chart and explain the throwable error exception relation
a.
                                 object
                                <class>
                                     ^

                                      ^

             <class>                                   <class>

This diagram illustrates the class hierarchy of the Throwable class and its most significant subclasses.
When a dynamic linking failure or some other "hard" failure in the virtual machine occurs, the virtual machine throws an Error.
Most programs throw and catch objects that derive from the Exception class. Exceptions indicate that a problem occurred but that the problem is not a serious systemic problem. Most programs we write will throw and catch Exceptions.
The RuntimeException class represents exceptions that occur within the Java virtual machine (during runtime). An example of a runtime exception is NullPointerException.

10. what is getMessage and printstacktrace
  a.Throwable's getMessage method returns the descriptive string stored in an exception.
     printstacktrace is a method of Java's throwable class which prints the throwable along with other details like the line      number and class name where the exception occurred.
