Arrays unique datatype (storing data in form of index with a fixed size, empty spaces are 0's )
creation: int a[]=new int[5];

1.through indexing we can give values 
arrray[ 0 to n-1]=values
a[]={values}
for(int i=o;i<a.length; i++)
{s.o.p(a[i])}

2. through  enhansed based for loop
for(data_type variable : array | collection){  
//body of for-each loop  
}  



>collections in java - list, set, map, etc.
package - folder structure used to maintain in project 
collections are present in util package

list is an interface

* Daimond operator in collections -it is used to define or fix the datatype
